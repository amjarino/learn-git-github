## To update an existing npm package, you can follow these steps:

1. Make the necessary changes to your code.
2. Bump the version number in your `package.json` file to indicate that a new version is being released.
3. Update the release notes in your `README.md` file to reflect the changes in the new version.
4. Commit your changes to your local Git repository.
5. Tag your commit with the new version number using the command `git tag <version>`.
6. Push your changes and tag to your remote Git repository.
7. Publish the new version of your package to npm using the command `npm publish`.

Here is an example of the command sequence:

```bash
# Make necessary changes and update package.json
vim package.json

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update to version 1.1.0"

# Tag commit
git tag 1.1.0

# Push changes and tag
git push origin master
git push origin 1.1.0

# Publish new version to npm
npm publish
```

`Note:` Before publishing a new version of your package, you should make sure that you have updated the version number and release notes correctly, and that your code is properly tested and working as intended.
